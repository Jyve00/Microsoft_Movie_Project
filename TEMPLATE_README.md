# Movie Analysis for Microsoft

**Authors**: Paul Shin, Derek Supino and Stephen William

## Overview

This is a project to provide Microsoft with a guide on what goes into creating and releasing a sucessfull movie based on data pulled from several reputable sources. Microsoft has launched its own movie studio but they don't know what tpye of film to release or even who to hire to help create a profitable film. The data was cleaned, organized and analysised to find out what the most sucessfull films of all time had in common with each other. With this information we can present the head of Microsoft's new movie studio what they can do to guarentee a sucessfull movie release.





A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer in order to solve them.

***
Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?
* Why are these questions important from a business perspective?
***

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***
